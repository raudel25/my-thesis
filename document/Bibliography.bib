  abstract = {Simple matrix languages and right-linear simple matrix languages are defined as subfamilies of matrix languages by putting restrictions on the form and length (degree) of the rewriting rules associated with matrix grammars. For each n ⩾ 1, let L(n)[ℛ(n)] be the class of simple matrix languages [right-linear simple matrix languages] of degree n, and let L=⋃n⩾1L(n)[ℛ=⋃n⩾1ℛ(n)]. It is shown that L(1)[ℛ(1)] coincides with the class of context-free languages [regular sets] and that L is a proper subset of the family of languages accepted by deterministic linear bounded automata. It is proved that L(n)[ℛ(n)] forms a hierarchy of classes of languages in L[ℛ]. The closure properties and decision problems associated with L(n), L, ℛ(n), and ℛ are thoroughly investigated. Let LB[ℛB] be the bounded languages in L[ℛ]. It is shown that LB=ℛB and that most of the positive closure and decision results which are true for bounded context-free languages are carried over in LB. A characterization of LB as the smallest family of languages which contains the bounded context-free languages and which is closed under the operations of union and intersection is proved.}

  abstract = {New algorithms for deciding whether a (propositional) Horn formula is satisfiable are presented. If the Horn formula A contains K distinct propositional letters and if it is assumed that they are exactly P1,…, PK, the two algorithms presented in this paper run in time O(N), where N is the total number of occurrences of literals in A. By representing a Horn proposition as a graph, the satisfiability problem can be formulated as a data flow problem, a certain type of pebbling. The difference between the two algorithms presented here is the strategy used for pebbling the graph. The first algorithm is based on the principle used for finding the set of nonterminals of a context-free grammar from which the empty string can be derived. The second algorithm is a graph traversal and uses a “call-by-need” strategy. This algorithm uses an attribute grammar to translate a propositional Horn formula to its corresponding graph in linear time. Our formulation of the satisfiability problem as a data flow problem appears to be new and suggests the possibility of improving efficiency using parallel processors.}

Here we show, for a large number of natural counting problems for which there was no previous indication of intractability, that they belong to this class. The technique used is that of polynomial time reduction with oracles via translations that are of algebraic or arithmetic nature. }
